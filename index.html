                    <h3>Cuckoo Attack Returning in Breath of the Wild</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A returning feature in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild comes in the form of the
                            cuckoos attacking Link. This is a hidden mechanic in most (if not all ) Zelda games where if
                            the player does enough damage to the chickens (cuckoos), an event is triggered which causes
                            many Cuckoos to fly down from the sky and attack the player.</li>

                    <h3>Secret Mechanic in Main-line Pokemon Games</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            There is a hidden mechanic in the mainline pokemon games that not many players actually know
                            about. This can be done by simply standing in (or near) tall grass in the overworld, going
                            into your pokemon menu, and selecting 'cut' from a pokemon that knows the Hidden Move.
                        </li>
                        <li>If you don't have the Cut HM you can find it from the Cut Masters house to the left of the
                            Pokemon Center in Rustboro City</li>

                        Fan Wiki</a>
                    <p>Kirby's Dreamland 3 contains a hidden boss called Zero (and his Dark Matter). This boss can only
                        be fought once Kirby has collected all of the Heart Stars. There are 30 of these in total, and
                        Kirby can only collect them once. Be sure to grab all 6 from each level in the game and you will
                        be able to unlock the Love-Love stick which allows you to defeat Zero's Dark Matter. In short,
                        this boss is unlocked by collecting all of the Heart Stars in the Game, it is the true final
                        boss of Kirby's Dreamland 3.</p>
